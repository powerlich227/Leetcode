 * 
 * H-Index
 * 
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, 
return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: 
A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.


Example 1:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == citations.length
1 <= n <= 5000
0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
 */
public class HIndex {
	// Counting Sort
	// buckets[citation]: 
	public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
		int n = citations.length, count = 0;
		int[] buckets = new int[n + 1];
		for (int c : citations) {
			if (c >= n)
				buckets[n]++;
			else
				buckets[c]++;
		}
		for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
			count += buckets[i];
			if (count >= i)
				return i;
		}
		return 0;
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		HIndex test = new HIndex();
		System.out.println(test.hIndex(new int[] {3, 0, 6, 1, 5}));
		System.out.println(test.hIndex(new int[] {1, 3, 1}));
	}
}
